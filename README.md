# Geotechnical AI Service

A FastAPI-based AI service that answers geotechnical engineering questions through intelligent retrieval from a specialized knowledge base and execution of geotechnical calculation tools.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The service implements a sophisticated **Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Synthesize** workflow:

1. **Plan**: Analyzes incoming questions to determine the appropriate action (retrieve, calculate, or both)
2. **Execute**: Performs retrieval from knowledge base and/or executes calculation tools
3. **Synthesize**: Combines results into professional engineering responses

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key
- Google GenAI API key (for OCR features)
- Optional: Qdrant and MongoDB (or use Docker Compose)

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maver1ch/geotech_ai_service.git
cd geotech_ai_service

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### 2. Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Start all services (app + databases)
docker-compose up -d

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 3. Alternative: Run Standalone

```bash
# Build and run the application only
docker build -t geotech-ai .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env geotech-ai
```

## üì° API Usage

### Ask a Question

```bash
# Geotechnical knowledge retrieval
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is CPT analysis and how is it used in Settle3?"
  }'

# Settlement calculation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Calculate settlement for a load of 1000 kN with Young modulus of 25000 kPa"
  }'

# Bearing capacity calculation  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Calculate bearing capacity for a 2m footing, soil unit weight 18 kN/m¬≥, depth 1.5m, friction angle 30¬∞"
  }'
```

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Returns: {"status": "ok"}
```

### Metrics

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
# Returns operational metrics including request counts, timing, success rates
```

## üß† Agent Intelligence

The GeotechAgent uses sophisticated decision logic:

### Planning Phase
- Analyzes question intent and domain scope
- Determines if question requires retrieval, calculation, or both
- Validates input parameters for calculations
- Rejects out-of-scope questions with clear explanations

### Execution Phase  
- **Retrieval**: Hybrid search combining vector similarity + keyword matching
- **Calculations**: Two specialized tools with comprehensive validation:
  - **Settlement Calculator**: `settlement = load / young_modulus`
  - **Bearing Capacity Calculator**: Terzaghi formula with bearing capacity factor interpolation

### Synthesis Phase (output answer)
- Combines retrieval and calculation results
- Provides professional, cited responses
- Maintains engineering accuracy and safety

## üõ†Ô∏è Geotechnical Tools

### Settlement Calculator
- **Formula**: `settlement = load / young_modulus`
- **Inputs**: Load (kN), Young's modulus (kPa)
- **Validation**: Positive values required
- **Output**: Settlement with calculation details

### Bearing Capacity Calculator  
- **Formula**: `q_ult = Œ≥*Df*Nq + 0.5*Œ≥*B*Nr` (Terzaghi, cohesionless soil)
- **Inputs**: 
  - B: Footing width/diameter (m)
  - Œ≥: Unit weight of soil (kN/m¬≥)  
  - Df: Footing depth (m)
  - œÜ: Internal friction angle (degrees, 0-40)
- **Features**: Bearing capacity factor interpolation for any angle 0-40¬∞
- **Output**: Ultimate bearing capacity with breakdown of calculations
